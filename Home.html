      <h3>DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</h3>
      <p >  Using the very latest diagnostic equipment and diagnostic software, our team of highly trained mechanics can access the internal data stored in the car’s onboard computer.
        This allows us to quickly identify issues and resolve problems that may be affecting the vehicle's performance.
        Our software interprets the outputs of a vehicle’s internal computer allowing us to offer clients a much more in-depth data-driven vehicle repair and vehicle service.
        Our diagnostic testing facilities have been installed with the appropriate software for all makes and models of cars and light commercial vehicles.
